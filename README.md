# Program-CPP_TLS24

## Introduction

- Name: Debert Jamie Chanderson
- Group: Newton

## Short Explanation

This program works by reading a comma-separated value (CSV) file named "niu.csv", which contains all the name and IDs of students. An input will be asked through the console for the student ID (a 6 digit number). After inserting the ID, the student will be marked as present and the program will ask whether to mark other student(s) as present or to exit the program (answered with a Y/y for yes and N/n for no).

> **The names in this file are randomly generated and have no specific meaning or association. The names are solely for testing purposes or demonstration and have no real-world significance.**

## Prerequisites

This program requires a "niu.csv" file, which will contain the student names and IDs, respectively. Some random student names and IDs have been written as a template in the file ([See here](https://github.com/debertjamie/Program-CPP_TLS24/blob/main/niu.csv)).

Failure to provide the file or written in a wrong order may cause error to the program.
